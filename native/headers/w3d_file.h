NAMING CONVENTIONS:

	Typical render object name is 15 characters + NULL
	Meshes have 31 + NULL character name formed from the concatenation of the "container"
		model name and the mesh's name: "ContainerName.MeshName"
	Animations have 31 + NULL character names formed from the concatenation of the Hierarchy tree
		name with the animation name: "AnimationName.HierarchyName"
	Textures have unlimited name length.
	Typically you can determine which 'W3D' file a render object came from by looking
		at its name. If the name contains a '.' then the filename is the string before
		the '.' and if not, then the render object name is the name of the file.

VERSION NUMBERS:

	Each Major chunk type will contain a "header" as its first
	sub-chunk. The first member of this header will be a Version
	number formatted so that its major revision number is the
	high two bytes and its minor revision number is the lower two
	bytes.

Version 1.0:

	MESHES - contained the following chunks:
		W3D_CHUNK_MESH_HEADER,			// header for a mesh
		W3D_CHUNK_VERTICES,				// array of vertices
		W3D_CHUNK_VERTEX_NORMALS,		// array of normals
		W3D_CHUNK_SURRENDER_NORMALS,	// array of surrender normals (one per vertex as req. by surrender)
		W3D_CHUNK_TEXCOORDS,				// array of texture coordinates
		W3D_CHUNK_MATERIALS,				// array of materials
		W3D_CHUNK_TRIANGLES,				// array of triangles
		W3D_CHUNK_SURRENDER_TRIANGLES,// array of surrender format tris	
		W3D_CHUNK_MESH_USER_TEXT,		// Name of owning hierarchy, text from the MAX comment field
		
	HIERARCHY TREES - contained the following chunks:
		W3D_CHUNK_HIERARCHY_HEADER,
		W3D_CHUNK_PIVOTS,
		W3D_CHUNK_PIVOT_FIXUPS,		

	HIERARCHY ANIMATIONS - contained the following chunks: 
		W3D_CHUNK_ANIMATION_HEADER,
		W3D_CHUNK_ANIMATION_CHANNEL,

	MESH CONNECTIONS - (blueprint for a hierarchical model) contained these chunks:

	 
Version 2.0:

	MESHES: 

	- Mesh header now contains the hierarchy model name. The mesh name will be built
	as <HModelName>.<MeshName> instead of the old convention: <HTreeName>.<Meshname>

	- The material chunk is replaced with a new material structure which contains 
	some information for animating materials.
	
	- Vertex Influences link vertices of a mesh to bones in a hierarchy, this is 
	the information needed for skinning. 
	
	- Damage chunks added. A damage chunk contains	a new set of materials, a set
	of vertex offsets, and a set of vertex colors.
	
	Added the following chunks:

		W3D_CHUNK_VERTEX_COLORS,		
		W3D_CHUNK_VERTEX_INFLUENCES,	
		W3D_CHUNK_DAMAGE,					
		W3D_CHUNK_DAMAGE_HEADER,
			W3D_CHUNK_DAMAGE_MATERIALS,
			W3D_CHUNK_DAMAGE_VERTICES,
			W3D_CHUNK_DAMAGE_COLORS,
		W3D_CHUNK_MATERIALS2,		

	MESH CONNECTIONS: Hierarchy models can now contain skins and collision meshes
	in addition to the normal meshes. 

		W3D_CHUNK_COLLISION_CONNECTION,		// collision meshes connected to the hierarchy
		W3D_CHUNK_SKIN_CONNECTION,				// skins connected to the hierarchy
		W3D_CHUNK_CONNECTION_AUX_DATA			// extension of the connection header


Dec 12, 1997

	Changed MESH_CONNECTIONS chunks into HMODEL chunks because the name
	mesh connections was becoming more and more inappropriate... This was only
	a data structure naming change so no-one other than the coders are affected

	Added W3D_CHUNK_LODMODEL. An LOD Model contains a set of names for
	render objects, each with a specified distance range.


Feb 6, 1998

	Added W3D_CHUNK_SECTMESH and its sub-chunks. This will be the file
	format for the terrain geometry exported from POV's Atlas tool. 

March 29, 1998 : Version 3.0

	- New material chunk which supports the new features of the 3D engine
	- Modified HTrees to always have a root transform to remove all of the
	 special case -1 bone indexes.
	- Added new mesh types, A mesh can now be categorized as: normal, 
	 aligned, skin, collision, or shadow.

June 22, 1998

	Removed the "SECTMESH" chunks which were never implemented or used.

	Adding a new type of object: The 'Tilemap'. This simple-sounding object
	is a binary partition tree of tiles where tiles are rectangular regions of
	space. In each leaf to the tree, a mesh is referenced. The tile map is 
	made of several chunks:
	
	- W3D_CHUNK_TILEMAP
		- W3D_CHUNK_TILEMAP_HEADER
		- W3D_CHUNK_TILES
			- W3D_CHUNK_MESH
			- W3D_CHUNK_MESH
			...

		- W3D_CHUNK_PARTITION_TREE
			- W3D_CHUNK_PARTITION_TREE_HEADER
			- W3D_CHUNK_PARTITION_TREE_NODES

		- W3D_CHUNK_TILE_INSTANCES
			- W3D_CHUNK_TILE_INSTANCE

October 19, 1998
	
	Created the w3d_obsolete.h header file and moved everything that I could into
	it. This header was getting so messy that even I couldn't understand it so
	hopefully this helps a little...

	Updating the mesh format as part of the conversion to Surrender1.40. Some
	of the new features in this mesh format are:
	- per pass, per stage U-V coordinate arrays
	- per pass vertex diffuse color arrays
	- per pass vertex specular color arrays
	- per pass vertex pre-calced diffuse illumination arrays
	
	In addition, the way you describe the materials for a mesh has *completely*
	changed. The new system separates the concepts of VertexMaterial, Texture
	and Shader. A VertexMaterial defines the parameters which control the 
	gradient calculations for vertices. Textures you know about. Shaders
	define how the gradients (diffuse and specular) are combined with the texture
	and the frame buffer. In addition, a mesh can have several passes; each
	pass having VertexMaterials, Textures and Shaders
	- new chunk to describe a shader, contains a W3dShaderStruct
	- new chunk to describe a vertex material, contains a W3dVertexMaterialStruct
	- textures use the old 'Map3' chunk still
	- new chunk to describe a "pass" for the mesh
	- new chunk to tie up all of these vertex materials, shaders, and textures
	- new chunks for specifying per-poly, per-pass arrays of texture, shader, and
	 vertex material indices.

	The culling system changed a bit requiring some re-working of the "Tilemap"
	so I have removed the tilemap chunks. At this point in time, all of the AABTree
	building is being done at run-time. Once we get the editor a little farther
	along, we'll define some new chunks for this stuff. 

	At this point in time, meshes look like the following. I've placed an asterisk
	next to the new chunk types.

	W3D_CHUNK_MESH
		W3D_CHUNK_MESH_HEADER3					
		W3D_CHUNK_MESH_USER_TEXT
		W3D_CHUNK_VERTICES
		W3D_CHUNK_VERTEX_NORMALS
		W3D_CHUNK_VERTEX_INFLUENCES
		W3D_CHUNK_TRIANGLES
*		W3D_CHUNK_VERTEX_SHADE_INDICES

*		W3D_CHUNK_MATERIAL_INFO					// how many passes, vertex mtls, shaders, and textures...
*		W3D_CHUNK_SHADERS							// array of W3dShaderStruct's
*		W3D_CHUNK_VERTEX_MATERIALS				
*			W3D_CHUNK_VERTEX_MATERIAL
*				W3D_CHUNK_VERTEX_MATERIAL_NAME
*				W3D_CHUNK_VERTEX_MATERIAL_INFO
			...

*		W3D_CHUNK_TEXTURES
*			W3D_CHUNK_TEXTURE
*				W3D_CHUNK_TEXTURE_NAME
*				W3D_CHUNK_TEXTURE_INFO
			...

*		W3D_CHUNK_MATERIAL_PASS
*			W3D_CHUNK_VERTEX_MATERIAL_IDS
*			W3D_CHUNK_SHADER_IDS

*			W3D_CHUNK_DCG
*			W3D_CHUNK_DIG
*			W3D_CHUNK_SCG
			
*			W3D_CHUNK_TEXTURE_STAGE
*				W3D_CHUNK_TEXTURE_IDS
*				W3D_CHUNK_STAGE_TEXCOORDS


	Added a Collection chunk type. When we export a bunch of independent meshes 
	(turning off the hierarchy and animation options) this chunk will be added 
	on to the end of the file. It lists by name each render object that was
	defined in the file. Presumably the run-time asset manager will be able
	to give you a "collection" render object which will be named the same as
	the w3d file that it came from and will contain the name or an actual instance
	of each of the meshes. This is a feature that was added for the Commando
	level editor.

	Added the W3D_CHUNK_POINTS chunk. This is used to implement "snap points"
	for the level editor. It is just an array of points that were found in
	the max scene (helper object->point). We make these points co-incide in
	the level editor to snap objects together. This chunk can occur inside a 
	mesh, hmodel, or collection chunk. When it does, the points should simply 
	be associated with the model being defined.

August 5, 1999

	Adding Null Object exporting

March 28, 2000

	Adding Merge objects to collections. We already have "Proxy" objects which ask
	the level editor to instatiate an object at a given transform. Now we will
	have "Merge" objects which mean a copy of the named model should be merged in
	with this model. This is used in the case of building interiors. We can create
	a building interior and lightmap it as a separate collection, then "merge" it
	with the level collection (multiple times even) and the tool will pre-transform
	the meshes and add them to the collection.

March 31, 2000

 Changed W3D_CHUNK_MERGE_NODE to W3D_CHUNK_TRANSFORM_NODE. Same data - slightly
 different application. Now the information will indicate how a w3d asset with the
 same name as that in the node should pre-transform itself relative to the object
 that contains the transform node.
 
April 07, 2000

 Added W3D_CHUNK_LIGHTSCAPE, W3D_CHUNK_LIGHTSCAPE_LIGHT and W3D_CHUNK_LIGHT_TRANSFORM.
 These chunks form part of the output of new Westwood light file type (.wlt).

July 10, 2000

 Added W3D_CHUNK_VERTEX_MAPPER_ARGS1 and renamed W3D_CHUNK_VERTEX_MAPPER_ARGS to
 W3D_CHUNK_VERTEX_MAPPER_ARGS0. These are the mapper args for the first and second
 texture stages. The choice of mapper for the second stage has been added to the
 'Attributes' field in W3dVertexMaterialStruct.

August 5, 2000

 Added W3D_CHUNK_LIGHT_GLARE and its sub-chunks. Light glares are going to
 be a new 'geometry type' which simply define points where light glare effects
 should be placed. The application will supply a callback to the WW3D code
 which indicates the visibilty of any light glares in the view frustum. 

June 5, 2001

 (gth) Adding line rendering options to particle systems today. This involves a
 new line-properties chunk and a RenderMode variable added to the InfoV2 struct.

	WHT ( Westwood Hierarchy Tree )

	A hierarchy tree defines a set of coordinate systems which are connected
	hierarchically. The header defines the name, number of pivots, etc. 
	The pivots chunk will contain a W3dPivotStructs for each node in the
	tree. 
	
	The W3dPivotFixupStruct contains a transform for each MAX coordinate
	system and our version of that same coordinate system (bone). It is 
	needed when the user exports the base pose using "Translation Only".
	These are the matrices which go from the MAX rotated coordinate systems
	to a system which is unrotated in the base pose. These transformations
	are needed when exporting a hierarchy animation with the given hierarchy
	tree file.

	Another explanation of these kludgy "fixup" matrices:

	What are the "fixup" matrices? These are the transforms which
	were applied to the base pose when the user wanted to force the
	base pose to use only matrices with certain properties. For 
	example, if we wanted the base pose to use translations only,
	the fixup transform for each node is a transform which when
	multiplied by the real node's world transform, yeilds a pure
	translation matrix. Fixup matrices are used in the mesh
	exporter since all vertices must be transformed by their inverses
	in order to make things work. They also show up in the animation
	exporter because they are needed to make the animation work with
	the new base pose.

	HMorphAnimClass

	This is an animation format which describes morphs between poses in another
	animation. It is used for Renegade's facial animation system. There is
	a normal anim which defines the pose for each phoneme and then a "Morph Anim"
	which defines the transitions between phonemes over time. In addition there
	is the concept of multiple morph channels in a morph anim. Each "channel"
	controls a set of pivots in the skeleton and has its own set of morph keys
	and poses. This lets us have one set of poses for expressions and another
	for phonemes (a bone is only moved in one or the other anims though)

	it is in. So its extents always point along the local coordinate system axes.
